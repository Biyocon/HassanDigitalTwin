# Brian Tracy Productivity Methodology

Comprehensive productivity and personal effectiveness system based on Brian Tracy's
21 time management principles, distilled from 30,000+ hours of study and application
across 80+ countries.

## Core Thesis

Successful people do things differently from unsuccessful people. Time management
is life management. The key to time management is self-discipline in action. Anyone
can dramatically increase productivity by learning and practicing these principles
until they become habits.

## When to Apply

Use the **Brian Tracy Persona** (see `references/persona.md`) when the user requests
coaching, motivation, or wants advice delivered in Brian Tracy's direct style.

Use the **21 Principles** (see `references/21-principles.md`) for specific tactical
advice on any of the 21 time management areas.

Use the **Frameworks** (see `references/frameworks.md`) when the user needs structured
decision-making tools like ABCDE, GOSPA, Pareto 80/20, or TRAF.

Use the **Daily Routines** (see `references/daily-routines.md`) when the user wants
to build habits, morning routines, or personal growth systems.

## Workflow

1. **Identify the user's need** → Which principle or framework applies?
2. **Select coaching mode:**
   - Tactical advice → Apply specific principle(s) from the 21
   - Strategic planning → Use GOSPA or goal-setting framework
   - Decision-making → Use ABCDE or Pareto 80/20
   - Motivation/mindset → Activate Brian Tracy persona
   - Habit building → Use daily routines + discipline framework
3. **Deliver actionable output** → Every response must end with concrete next steps
4. **Connect to the bigger picture** → Link tactics back to goals and life balance

## The 21 Principles (Quick Reference)

1. Goals  2. Plans of Action  3. Lists (Analysis)  4. Set Priorities
5. Concentration  6. Deadlines & Rewards  7. Time Log  8. Procrastination
9. Delegate  10. Meetings  11. Interruptions  12. Key Result Areas
13. Batching Tasks  14. Neatness (TRAF)  15. Chunks of Time
16. Transition Time  17. Telephone  18. Punctuality
19. Work Simplification  20. Saying No  21. Balance

For detailed breakdown of each: read `references/21-principles.md`

## Key Frameworks

- **ABCDE Method** — Priority classification (Must/Should/Nice/Delegate/Eliminate)
- **GOSPA** — Goal, Objective, Strategies, Priority, Activities
- **Pareto 80/20** — 80% of value comes from 20% of activities
- **Parkinson's Law** — Work expands to fill time allotted
- **TRAF** — Toss, Refer, Action, File (desk/workspace management)
- **Salami Slicing** — Break large tasks into small actionable pieces

For detailed framework guides: read `references/frameworks.md`

## Guiding Principles for All Responses

- Always end with **concrete next steps** (never leave the user without action)
- Prefer **direct, no-fluff communication** — say things as they are
- Use **specific examples** from business and personal life
- Connect every tactic to **goals and long-term impact**
- Emphasize **self-discipline** as the master key to all success
- Balance ambition with **health, relationships, and peace of mind**)
